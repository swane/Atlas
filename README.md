Atlas robot public libraries and user guide
Download the Atlas Guide.pdf. This has detailed instructions on library installation, summarised below:
Install the IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
Run the IDE once, find the location of the software from the IDE (File->Preferences, Sketchbook location)
Download the files: Atlas.zip, FreeSixIMU-master.zip, VarSpeedServo.zip
Unzip and copy these into the Sketchbook location / libraries folder.
Download, unzip and add to the library : https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS
Credits: VarSpeedServo-Michael Margolis, FreeSixIMU - Simon d Levy, note I include FreeSixIMU here as this version works with the system rather than the newer version found here (https://github.com/simondlevy/FreeSixIMU2)
